# 🔧 Plaid Integration Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Plaid Authentication Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Plaid exchange API was receiving requests without Firebase auth token
**Solution**: Updated `PlaidLinkScreen` to send `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header

**Before**:
```typescript
fetch('/api/plaid/exchange-public-token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  credentials: 'include', // Only cookies
  body: JSON.stringify({ public_token }),
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const token = await auth.currentUser.getIdToken();
fetch('/api/plaid/exchange-public-token', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`, // ✅ Added auth header
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ public_token }),
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging** ✅ ADDED
Added comprehensive logging throughout the Plaid flow:
- ✅ **Plaid Exchange API**: Tracks auth, token exchange, accounts, transactions
- ✅ **Firebase Transactions**: Tracks Firestore queries and results
- ✅ **Error Details**: Better error messages with context

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Firestore Rules
**CRITICAL**: You must deploy the updated Firestore rules first!

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/writeoff-23910/firestore/rules
2. **Verify rules match** the updated `firestore.rules` file
3. **Click "Publish"** if not already deployed

### Step 2: Test Plaid Integration
1. **Open browser dev tools** (F12) → Console tab
2. **Refresh your app**: http://localhost:3002
3. **Complete profile setup** if needed
4. **Connect a bank account** via Plaid Link

### Step 3: Watch Console Logs
You should see this sequence of logs:

#### ✅ **Successful Plaid Connection**:
```
🔑 Got Firebase token for Plaid API call
🔄 [Plaid Exchange] Starting token exchange...
✅ [Plaid Exchange] User authenticated: {user-id}
🔑 [Plaid Exchange] Got public token, length: 123
🔄 [Plaid Exchange] Exchanging public token...

```

#### ✅ **Successful Transaction Fetching**:
```

🔍 [Firebase] Fetching transactions for user: {user-id}
📊 [Firebase] Query returned 45 transactions
📡 Response status: 200
✅ Transactions loaded: 45
```

### Step 4: Verify Data in Firestore
1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/writeoff-23910/firestore/data
2. **Check structure**:
```
user_profiles/
  └── {your-user-id}/
      ├── plaid_token: "access-sandbox-xyz..."
      └── accounts/
          └── {account-id}/
              ├── name: "Checking Account"
              ├── type: "depository"
              └── transactions/
                  └── {transaction-id}/
                      ├── merchant_name: "Starbucks"
                      ├── amount: 4.50
                      ├── date: "2024-01-15"
                      └── user_id: "{your-user-id}"
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "Unauthorized" during Plaid connection
**Check**: Browser console for Firebase auth token
**Fix**: Make sure user is signed in and `auth.currentUser` exists

### Issue: "No transactions found" 
**Check**: Firestore console for saved data
**Possible causes**:
- Firestore rules not deployed
- Plaid sandbox account has no transactions
- Date range issue (transactionsSync gets recent transactions)

### Issue: Plaid API errors
**Check**: Environment variables are correct
```bash
grep -E "PLAID_" .env.local
```

## 📋 **Environment Variables Confirmed**
✅ `PLAID_CLIENT_ID=687d5087551e1a0025da2d22`  
✅ `PLAID_SECRET=da1675859a329950b888b2373b3650`  
✅ `PLAID_ENV=sandbox`

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After these fixes:
- ✅ Plaid connection should complete without errors
- ✅ Accounts and transactions should save to Firestore
- ✅ Transaction fetching should return Plaid data
- ✅ Dashboard should display imported transactions
- ✅ All API calls should have proper authentication

The integration should now work end-to-end! 🚀
